Things to fix to get Sandbox to work in it's former glory:

	- get rid of OpenGL error: "Invalid Enumerated argument -- 1280"
	- use spheres for Sun and Moon
	- DONE: fix textures
	- fix lighting
	- fix speed

Optional (but probably beneficial fixes)
	- use FreeVR billboarding for orienting text (instead of
		doing it by hand).
	- tie speed to that of the computer
	- clean up all the OGLXXX stuff from the toogl script
	- completely clean the code up (ie. all the rest of the stuff).
